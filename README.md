# Custom Launcher for Palia

this is simple PoC launcher written in C# that is capable of handling new update manifest format introduced in Palia 0.173.0

There's a lot that can (and should) be done to the code before it's anywhere near production ready... including optimizations
(for example see my [Steam Downloader](https://github.com/klukule/SteamDownloader) which would be the end goal since palia follows similar architecture)

Uses the [FlexBuffers-CSharp](https://github.com/mzaks/FlexBuffers-CSharp) library from github, licensed under MIT
